//! This cargo crate contains a set of useful unit testing utilities, designed
//! for the purpose of reducing boilerplate code when writing unit tests for
//! Bevy. This module focuses primarily on test cleanliness rather than
//! performance. As such, it is not recommended to use this library in a
//! production setting. This crate is intended to be used as a development
//! dependency only.
